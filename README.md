# TIS
Today I Skimmed<br/>
Obvisously inspired by [TIL](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), duh.
<br/><br/>
I skim a bunch of articles from newsletters everyday and sometimes I find something useful that I can use / try right away, sometimes I just have an "ah ah" moment. I share it with some people that I think will find it interesting too but when I saw Josh project I thought I could do more of it :) <sub><sup>(also, I spam my friends too much)</sup></sub>
