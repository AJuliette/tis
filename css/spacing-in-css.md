## Spacing In CSS

[Source](https://ishadeed.com/article/same-html-different-css/)

I still have a long way on my CSS knowledge, but here's what I grepped:
- margin collapses: 
```
In simple words, margin collapse happens when two vertical elements have a margin, and one of them
has a greater margin than the other. In that case, the greater margin will be used, and the other 
will be ignored.
```
Guess why I could not make my margins work ?
