## The "responsive" you always hear about comes from architecture design

Ehtan Marcotte coined the term "responsive" for the web 10 years ago. He explains in this article that he got the idea 
from his partner who saw [movable wheeled chair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6IrqxRrLbU) during a trip to New-York and 
after a few reading he learnt that this type of architecture was called "interactive" or "responsive". That's where it clicked.
I liked how web can be connected to design like that !
