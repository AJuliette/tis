# My favourite Git commit

[Source](https://dhwthompson.com/2019/my-favourite-git-commit)

Forgive me reader for I have sinned: I regularly commit `Fixes something`. But when I read the article above I solemnly swore that I'll tend to write beautiful commits like this one.

I already read that a commit should not explain <strong>what</strong> was changed but <strong>why</strong> the code needed change and I think it does make smarter commit.

I never tried `git log --grep "something in log to look up"`, I guess you should have in your company a strong emphasis on commits to act as documentation to have a valuable use of it.

Having browsed repos trying to understand changes and their histories, I am really convinced that good commits can save a lot of time for futur developpers (or your future self).
